A minimal project to show an new error in the Three20 project introducted by the iOS4.

To reproduce this error make again the following steps:

1. lauch the sample app
2. turn the iphone in landscape orientation
3. select a row
4. turn the iphone in portrait mode
5. go back to the previous controller

maybe you'll have to do it 2 or 3 times, and you should see that some rows are not correctly rendered.

If anyone can help us to find and fix this bug, I'll appreciate.
Thanks guys
